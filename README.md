# Eireann Coelho
Hi! I'm @EireannCoelho, a senior at the University of Oregon, pursuing a Bachelor’s in Computer Science with minors in Multimedia and Dance. 
My academic journey has led me to discover passions for technology, creativity, and movement. I’m excited to find opportunities that 
allow me to merge these interests in unique and innovative ways. I thrive at the intersection of logic and artistry—whether it's solving 
complex coding problems or expressing myself through dance.

I have a deep interest in software development, multimedia design, and how technology can elevate artistic expression. My coursework 
has given me hands-on experience in coding, web development, UX/UI design, and visual storytelling. Additionally, my background in dance 
has taught me discipline, collaboration, and how to think outside the box—skills I bring into every project I work on.

As I continue my studies with an additional year, I’m actively seeking 2025 internship opportunities that will allow me to bridge the 
gap between technology and creativity. I’m particularly interested in roles where I can contribute to innovative tech solutions while 
incorporating elements of multimedia design or performance arts.
